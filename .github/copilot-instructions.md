This is a Next.js TypeScript project for a developer project recommendation platform. The project uses:

- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React Server Components** and client components where needed

## Key Guidelines:

1. Use TypeScript for all components and maintain strict type safety
2. Follow Next.js App Router conventions with the `src/app` directory structure
3. Use Tailwind CSS classes for all styling - avoid inline styles or CSS modules
4. Create reusable components in the `src/components` directory
5. Use React Server Components by default, only add 'use client' when necessary
6. Follow modern React patterns with hooks and functional components
7. Implement responsive design with Tailwind's responsive utilities
8. Use semantic HTML elements for accessibility
9. Include proper TypeScript interfaces for all props and data structures
10. Follow Next.js best practices for performance optimization

## Project Structure:
- Landing page components for the developer project recommendation platform
- Features include smart matching, tech stack recommendations, and development roadmap
- Clean, developer-focused design with professional branding
